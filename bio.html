	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p class = "bio"> Hello! My name is Esther and I use my creativity and technical skills to tell stories that center communities of color. As a Computer Science and American Studies double major at Tufts, I'm always finding new ways to intersect tech, art, and advocacy through interactive media and games.
	</p>
	<br><br>
	<p class = "bio"> When I'm not coding, drawing, or reading, you can find me playing my trumpet, performing experiments in the kitchen, or watching Hong Kong TV to practice my Cantonese. Reclaiming my first language! A beautiful thing.
