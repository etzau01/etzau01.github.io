      <h3>Tufts Observer: Interactive Recipes</h3>
      <p>For this project, we used Eko, a choose-your-own-adventure tool for interactive videos.  We loved linking our animations together in this way and will continue to find ways to unify our artwork as a team.</p>

      <h3>Tufts Observer: Missed Connections</h3>
      <p>This semester, I joined the Observer’s new multimedia team! We create content for the publication and experiment with visual journalism and interactive web design. For our first project, we collected “missed connection” story submissions from across campus, and each of us chose one to animate and bring to life. Watch them here: Tufts Observer Missed Connections</p>

      <h3>Media Culture now Magazine</h3>
      <p>In my class “Media Culture Now”, we studied media with a critical lens and responded to the topic of the week by creating a poster/collage. At the end of the semester, we compiled all of our posters into a magazine. I created a digital copy, so click below to flip through!</p>

      <h3>Film: Walking Through a Divided Chinatown</h3>
      <p> The prompt for our first individual assignment in Film Production class was “A Day in the Life,” and my project documents a day walking through Boston’s Chinatown. Beginning with the development of two interstate highways in the 1950s, which destroyed the center of the community and displaced over a thousand residents, Chinatown has become increasingly gentrified by high-income housing units and the expansion of Tufts University. Amidst the division, I wanted to show the vitality of the neighborhood, because Chinatown is such an important center for its immigrant residents and the broader Asian American community.</p>

      <p>Poster design selected to market the winter play. "The Undiscovered Country" takes place during the 1960’s, in an American private school where students begin to disappear.
